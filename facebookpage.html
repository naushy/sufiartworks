Every artwork posses rhythms that beautifies it. Whether it be rhythm of colors that are in paintings, rhythm of notes/swara in raga/melody, Rhythm of postures in dance etc. These rhythms can be identified and coded into computing environment. We are trying to bridge art and tech. Why? Because most of our local artist who are not techies and English speaking but are exceptional, they are looking for visibility in an environment that is fair, global and inclusive.
This is one of the main cause why art is dying in our country and we need to save and preserve that.

We invite all techies who are art lovers from all around the world towards addressing this issue and counter it using technology as motivating tool. We are reasearching on machine learning algorithms that can be trained based on the rhythms any art work is producing. We are trying to figure out parameters that can report out scientifically any art work to be fall in category of fine art. We want to create and promote a transparent and fair system for artist in our country that currently does not exist.

Wanna Give /Take help ?
If you are professional in any field already we would like your ideas about criteria and standards of a judging the art. Art is only commercially successful when it is able to entertain the public on huge amount. But there are some artists who are laid behind as their work is only comprehensible to brainy people and cannot bring charm to an average mind. Such artist need special attention to be visible and get what they truly deserves.

If you are student or amateur artistit would be great if you can introduce our area of work to the research professor/ lecturer/ teacher/ mentor in relevant area who would like to share their idea, suggestions etc as we find them really critical and valuable.

If you are personality development professional or psychologist, please share your views about empathy, mathematical magnitude to calculate empathy level.
